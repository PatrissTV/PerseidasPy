The automated parallax software allows us to calculate several parameters of the trajectory of a meteor using two video sources. It is easy to manage and allows us to calculate trajectories very fast and completely autonomously.

This software can also be used for bolid or plane tracking, as well as other visible objects that travel through our atmosphere.

This package includes several modules for astrometry, vectors, area calculation and minimization and a frame selection tool.
