The automated parallax software allows us to calculate several parameters of the trajectory of a meteor using two video sources. Even though the results can vary remarkably depending on the selection method of the brightness area plot and the selection of the position of the meteor, we can ensure that our software commits an error of $\pm$5km in our example starting off the inputs that we, as users, provide to it. 

It is easy to manage and allows us to calculate trajectories very fast and completely autonomously, given a certain input of positions, images and brightness area plots.

This software can also be used for bolid or plane tracking, as well as other visible objects that travel through our atmosphere.
